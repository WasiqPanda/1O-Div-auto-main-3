The HQDashboard.js file has become too complex (800+ lines) and causes Babel compilation errors.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Split into smaller components (MapView, PatrolList, SearchFilters)
2. Remove nested functions and callbacks
3. Simplify state management

For now, I'll restore the last working version before search/filter additions.
